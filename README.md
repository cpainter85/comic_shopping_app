[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cpainter85/comic_shopping_app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cpainter85/comic_shopping_app)

This project allows users to search and browse information about various comic books and links them to vendors selling that particular comic digitally. For example, a user could search for and find Action Philosophers #1 and see not only information about this particular comic (such as who wrote it, who drew it, what characters appear in it, etc) but also the different vendors selling a digital version of it and for what price. In this particular case, they might see that it is available to purchase on Amazon Kindle for $8.28, on Dark Horse Digital for $18.99, on Google Play for $14.74 and Sequential for $16.99 and would directly link to the respective pages on the vendor's site to make purchasing easier for the user.

Technical Notes

Built on Rails with a PostgreSQL database with some jQuery used.
